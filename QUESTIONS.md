The MVP table requires auto‑refresh every 5–12 seconds. The Instagram Graph API’s Business Discovery endpoints are capped at roughly 200 requests per hour per account (~18 s per call). Polling every 5–12 seconds will quickly exhaust the limit and trigger throttling, contradicting the later constraint to respect rate limits and making the success metrics unachievable. The PRD should raise the default interval or describe a caching strategy that keeps the API call rate within Meta’s quotas.

The backend section specifies a Node.js + Express server but the hosting bullet directs deployment to Cloudflare Workers or Supabase Edge. Both targets run on lightweight V8/Deno runtimes that do not support the Node standard library or Express middleware model, so this architecture cannot actually be deployed as written. Either the framework or the hosting choice needs to change to avoid a dead‑end implementation path.
