# TODO

- [x] Evaluate backend runtime options and select MVP target (Workers vs Node).
- [x] Update README to reflect the chosen runtime and remove conflicting guidance.
- [x] Update PLAN.md with implementation steps for the selected backend approach.
- [x] Document fetch and cache workflow for the chosen platform (Workers APIs).

## Review
- Chose Cloudflare Workers + KV as the MVP backend target and updated README/PLAN with Worker-specific architecture, deployment, and cache flow details.
